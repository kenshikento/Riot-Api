This is league of legends Api that helps you find live match information.

Improvements that can be made or functionality issues

Custom games cannot be done using this application/
The user will have to have a Solo or Flex rank in order to use it/
On the dragon server some champion images do not appear so the fix would be to download all images/
There is no rate limiting on this application therefore it cannot go live however there is cache method implemented on Summoners and champion info/
